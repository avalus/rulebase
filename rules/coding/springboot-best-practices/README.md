# SpringBoot Best Practices

This rule provides comprehensive guidelines for AI agents when developing Spring Boot applications using Java or Kotlin. It enforces the following best practices:

- Follow Spring Boot conventions and auto-configuration patterns
- Implement proper layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository → Entity)
- Use appropriate Spring annotations and dependency injection
- Ensure security, validation, and error handling best practices
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies
- Follow performance optimization and monitoring guidelines
- Maintain code quality and production readiness standards

These guidelines make the rule ideal for creating robust, maintainable, and enterprise-grade Spring Boot applications that follow industry standards and best practices for both Java and Kotlin development.
