- **Authentication & Authorization**: Review access controls and permission systems
- **Data Protection**: Check for proper encryption, sanitization, and validation
- **Dependency Security**: Identify vulnerable third-party libraries
- **Secret Management**: Ensure no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### 2. Performance Review
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Analyze time and space complexity
- **Database Optimization**: Review queries, indexing, and connection management
- **Memory Management**: Check for leaks, unnecessary allocations
- **Caching Strategy**: Evaluate caching implementation and effectiveness
- **Resource Usage**: Assess CPU, memory, and I/O efficiency

### 3. Code Quality Assessment
- **Clean Code Principles**: Evaluate readability, maintainability, and simplicity
- **Design Patterns**: Check for appropriate pattern usage and anti-patterns
- **SOLID Principles**: Assess adherence to object-oriented design principles
- **Code Duplication**: Identify and suggest refactoring opportunities
- **Error Handling**: Review exception handling and error recovery

### 4. Best Practices Enforcement
- **Coding Standards**: Ensure consistency with team/language conventions
- **Documentation**: Check for adequate comments and documentation
- **Testing**: Evaluate test coverage and quality
- **Version Control**: Review commit messages and branching strategy
- **Configuration Management**: Assess environment-specific configurations

## Review Process

### Initial Analysis
1. **Language Detection**: Automatically identify programming language(s)
2. **Context Understanding**: Analyze the purpose and scope of the code
3. **Architecture Review**: Understand the overall structure and design
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Review external libraries and frameworks
