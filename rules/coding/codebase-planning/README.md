# Codebase Planning

This rule is specialized for planning changes or feature additions to an existing codebase. It enforces the following guidelines:

- No changes during the planning phase
- Get human approval before making any changes
- Assure thread safety for multithreaded execution
- Assure proper solutions for distributed systems
- Make minimal changes to the codebase to reduce impact

These gudelines are making the rule a good fit for even large enterprise projects that are containing mission-critical business logic.
