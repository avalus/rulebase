# 📊 RuleBase Rating System

> How we use GitHub reactions to rate and discover the best AI agent rules

## 🌟 Overview

RuleBase uses GitHub's native reaction system to let the community rate AI agent rules. This approach is simple, transparent, and leverages GitHub's existing infrastructure while providing meaningful insights into rule quality and usefulness.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Rating Rules

Every rule in RuleBase can be rated using GitHub reactions on the rule's README file. We've made this process easier with direct rating buttons:

1. **Navigate to a rule** - Browse to any rule's README.md file
2. **Click the "Rate This Rule" button** - Look for the prominent blue button in the Community Rating section
3. **Use GitHub's reaction interface** - Scroll to the bottom of the GitHub page and click the emoji button (😊)
4. **Choose your reaction** - Select the reaction that best represents your experience
5. **Your rating is recorded** - GitHub automatically tracks your reaction

**Alternative method:** You can also rate by navigating directly to the rule's README on GitHub and using the native reaction buttons at the bottom of the page.

### Reaction Meanings

Each GitHub reaction has a specific meaning in our rating system:

| Reaction | Meaning | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 👍 **Thumbs Up** | Works great, recommended! | The rule works as described and you'd recommend it to others |
| ❤️ **Heart** | Love this rule, essential for workflow | This rule has become essential to your daily workflow |
| 🚀 **Rocket** | Game-changer, significantly improved productivity | This rule dramatically improved your productivity or capabilities |
| 👀 **Eyes** | Interesting, want to try this | You find the rule interesting and plan to test it |
| 😕 **Confused** | Needs improvement or clarification | The rule has issues, unclear documentation, or didn't work as expected |

## 📈 Rating Calculation

### Quality Score Formula

Each rule's overall quality score is calculated using this weighted formula:

```
Quality Score = (👍 × 1.0) + (❤️ × 1.5) + (🚀 × 2.0) + (👀 × 0.5) - (😕 × 1.0)
```

**Weighting Rationale:**
- **🚀 Rocket (2.0x)** - Highest weight for transformative impact
- **❤️ Heart (1.5x)** - High weight for essential workflow integration  
- **👍 Thumbs Up (1.0x)** - Standard positive rating
- **👀 Eyes (0.5x)** - Lower weight for interest without usage
- **😕 Confused (-1.0x)** - Negative weight for problems

### Example Calculation

A rule with 100👍, 50❤️, 25🚀, 30👀, 10😕 would score:
```
Score = (100 × 1.0) + (50 × 1.5) + (25 × 2.0) + (30 × 0.5) - (10 × 1.0)
Score = 100 + 75 + 50 + 15 - 10 = 230 points
```

## 🏆 Rating Categories

### Star Rating Conversion

For easy understanding, we convert quality scores to star ratings:

| Stars | Score Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 200+ points | Exceptional - Top-tier rules |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 100-199 points | Excellent - Highly recommended |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | 50-99 points | Good - Solid, useful rules |
| ⭐⭐ | 20-49 points | Fair - Decent but may need improvement |
| ⭐ | 0-19 points | Needs Work - Significant issues or very new |

### Hall of Fame

Rules with exceptional ratings are featured in our [Hall of Fame](./HALL_OF_FAME.md):

- **🥇 Gold Tier** - 500+ points, consistently top-rated
- **🥈 Silver Tier** - 300-499 points, excellent community feedback
